# Ansible Sample Code

This repository contains sample code for automating Veeam deployment/configuration of various Veeam solutions using Ansible.

[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications ‚Äî automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems. There are both [paid](https://www.ansible.com/products/pricing) and [open-source](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) versions of Ansible.

## üìó Documentation

Documentation, including usage instructions, can be found with each Ansible role.

The Ansible code in this repository is part of a [collection in Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/veeamhub/veeam). Easiest method to install it in your environment is using [Ansible Galaxy](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html):

`ansible-galaxy collection install veeamhub.veeam`
